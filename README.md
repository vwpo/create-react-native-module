See below for command-line usage, example with no view, and example with an extremely simple native view.

This tool based on [`react-native-create-library`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-create-library), with working example callbacks, optional native view, and more updates added by [@brodybits (Christoper J. Brody aka Chris Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) and other [contributors](https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module/graphs/contributors).

### Support options

- community support via [issues](https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module/issues)
- commercial support is available, see <http://xpbrew.consulting>

<!-- FUTURE TODO: QUICK USAGE SECTION HERE -->

### General status

- Minimum React Native version: 0.60 (outdated), 0.61 (recommended)
- Platform fork support
  - tvOS platform fork
    - requires use of `--tvos-enabled` option as documented below
    - requires the [`react-native-tvos`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-tvos) fork, with minimum version of 0.60 ref:  [react-native-community/react-native-tvos#11](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tvos/issues/11)), [issue #95](https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module/issues/95)
    - unstable with very limited testing, with limited if any active support from the primary maintainer [@brodybits](https://github.com/brodybits) (see [issue #127](https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module/issues/127))
- Out-of-tree platforms
  - Windows - no longer supported for reasons discussed in issues [#23](https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module/issues/23) and [#43](https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module/issues/43) (existing Windows C# template is kept in `unsupported-platforms` for now (at least) and further discussion would be welcome in a new issue on GitHub)
  - for future consideration: macOS (see [issue #94](https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module/issues/94))
- Node.js pre-10 support is deprecated and will be removed in the near future (see [issue #38](https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module/issues/38))

### Why might you need this?

If you are looking to create a native module for React Native, you need some native code for each platform you want to support and then some JavaScript code to bind it all together. Setting this up by yourself can be time-consuming.

This is where this tool comes in. It creates a boilerplate with all current best practices in mind.
Why not use `react-native new-library`? Unfortunately that command doesn't create an up-to-date library, requires an already initialized React Native project and only sets up the iOS side of things.

### Alternatives

- [`brodybits/react-native-module-init`](https://github.com/brodybits/react-native-module-init) - new interactive CLI that uses the templates from this utiity
- [`react-native-community/bob`](https://github.com/react-native-community/bob) - opinionated, interactive library CLI that is designed to support both native libraries and libraries with web support

## Installation

Requirements: Node 8.0+

Packages required to be installed globally if the recommended example app is generated:

- [`react-native-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli)
- [`yarn`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)

```
$ npm install -g react-native-cli yarn
```

To install this package:

```
$ npm install -g create-react-native-module
```

## Command-line usage

Navigate into an empty directory to execute the command.
```
$ create-react-native-module MyFancyLibrary
```

This will create the folder `MyFancyLibrary` in which the library will be created in.

Now install dependencies by running this command in the newly created library.
```
$ npm install
```

```

## Examples

### Example module with no view

__Create the module with no view:__

```
create-react-native-module --prefix CB --package-identifier io.mylibrary --generate-example AliceHelper
```

The module would be generated in the `react-native-alice-helper` subdirectory, and the example test app would be in `react-native-alice-helper/example`.

Then go into the example app subdirectory:

```
cd react-native-alice-helper/example
```

#### Running the example app

**Recommended:** Follow the instructions shown in the end of the console log output, which are more likely to be up-to-date.

__Extra notes:__

_Within the example test app subdirectory:_

It is *recommended* to start the Metro Bundler manually (within `react-native-alice-helper/example`), which would run in the foreground:

```
yarn start
```

Otherwise, React Native will open its own window to run the Metro Bundler.

To run on Android, do the following command (within `react-native-alice-helper/example`):

```
react-native run-android
```

This assumes that the `ANDROID_HOME` environmental variable is set properly. Here is a sample command that does not make such an assumption on a mac:

```
ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk react-native run-android
```

For iOS:

Extra installation step needed _in case of clean checkout only_:

```
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Then to run on iOS:

```
react-native run-ios
```

or do the following command to open the iOS project in Xcode:

```
open ios/example.xcodeproj
```

#### Expected result

The example app shows the following indications:

- STATUS: native callback received
- NATIVE CALLBACK MESSAGE with the number argument and string argument values that are received by the native module

### Example view module

__Create the module with an extremely simple view:__

```
create-react-native-module --prefix CB --package-identifier io.mylibrary --view --generate-example CarolWidget
```

The module would be generated in the `react-native-carol-widget` subdirectory, and the example test app would be in `react-native-carol-widget/example`.

Note that this needs an adaptation to work on Android on React Native 0.60(+) (see [issue #29](https://github.com/brodybits/create-react-native-module/issues/29)).

Then go into the example app subdirectory:

```
cd react-native-carol-widget/example
```

#### Running the view example app

**Recommended:** Follow the instructions shown in the end of the console log output, which are more likely to be up-to-date.

__Some extra notes:__

_Within the example test app subdirectory:_

It is *recommended* to start the Metro Bundler manually as described above (within `react-native-carol-widget/example`):

```
yarn start
```

To run on Android: do `react-native run-android` as described for the other example above.

To run on iOS (as described above):

- _in case of clean checkout **only**_: do `pod install` in `ios` subdirectory
- do `react-native run-ios` or `open ios/example.xcodeproj`

__Expected result:__

- on Android: a check box that is checked (and cannot be changed)
- on iOS: a label with 5 red asterisks
